# How To Test Streaming

Ad Hoc events are the easiest way to test streaming on Slipmat.

::: danger Be early!
Ad Hoc events can only be streamed when your next scheduled event is at least 60 minutes away or you don't have one lined up.

## Test Ad Hoc Stream

This is the recommended way to test streaming on Slipmat. It's easy, fast, and the Live Page works exactly as with scheduled pages.

1. Set up your streamer. You'll find the needed Streaming URL and Key from your [Artist dashboard](https://next.slipmat.io/artist/).
2. Start streaming.
3. Open your [Stream Monitor](https://next.slipmat.io/artist/stream/). It should show that the stream is connected and an Ad Hoc event is about to start.
4. When the event has started, click the link to the public event page to verify everything works (the URL is always `/[artist-slug]/live/`)

::: warning Warning: Ad hoc event chat is your artist chat channel
Ad hoc events use your artist chat channel for the event chat. Whatever you post there stays there for everyone to see!
