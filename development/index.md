# Slipmat Development Process

Slipmat is developed with a very open process. The [developer documentation](https://developer.slipmat.io/) explains everything in great detail but for most users there's justa couple of important things to know and follow: how to report issues and the roadmap.

::: tip NOTE
Slipmat is a community project. That means **everyone in the Slipmat community can help and affect the development process.**

## How To Report Issues
