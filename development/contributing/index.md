# Contributing

These docs, like all other open Slipmat code, live on [Slipmat GitHub](https://github.com/slipmatio). You need to [register a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) in order to submit changes. The same account can also be used to submit and follow tickets, and help with working on Slipmat code and other docs.

## How To Submit Content And Corrections

Every page on this documentation site has a "Edit this page"-link at the bottom of the page. After you've created your GitHub account, just click that link, make edits and submit them as a pull reguest (the GitHub edit page guides you, you just need to click a button).

## Technical Stuff

- [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) is the software that powers the docs
