# Slipmat.io Code of Conduct

Slipmat.io community is made up of a mixture of professionals, hobbyists and music lovers from all over the world. Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and confrontations. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask all members to adhere to, this code also applies equally to the DJs.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the musical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Slipmat.io team. This includes the Web site, event chatrooms, the Facebook groups, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

Be friendly, considerate, and most of all be respectful. Try to treat others as you would want them to treat you. We at Slipmat.io strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

Remember that we're a world-wide community, and not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Slipmat.io comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then STOP.

If you believe a member is in violating the code of conduct or if you experience/witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns please report it by emailing conduct@slipmat.io.
