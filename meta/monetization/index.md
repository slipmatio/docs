# Monetization

Slipmat is a **100% community-funded project**. We've been around since 2016 and unlike the dozens of commercial alternatives over the years, we are not planning to go away as long as we have awesome supporters like you.

There is no legal organization or a company behind Slipmat (yet). If there ever will be, it will be a nonprofit or a benefit corporation (a company whose sole purpose is to do good).

### Where does the money go?

Here are some of the things that costs us money, roughly in order of cost:

- Servers (we self-host everything on [Hetzner servers](https://www.hetzner.com))
- Object storage and backups ([Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com))
- Emails ([Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/))
- CDN ([Bunny.net](https://bunny.net))
- Domain names (`slipmat.io` and `sli.pm`, currently handled by [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net))
- Developer tools and licences (for example Apple Developer License needed to publish signed native apps, API access to Spotify, Tidal, etc.)
