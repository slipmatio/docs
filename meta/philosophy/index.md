# Slipmat Mission and Philosophy

Our mission is to create outstanding musical experiences and provide affordable tools for artists.

We see music as an art but we also understand that it's a source of income for many.

## Advertising

**You will never see ads on Slipmat.io**, that's a promise.

What you _might_ see instead is meaningful partnersips that are unintrusive for the listening experience, ethical, and genuinely useful for the artists. (As I write this, we've never done anything like this so far. But having a music gear reseller sponsor a virtual festival or a competition would for example be a good fit that could be done in a way that would benefit everyone, for example.)
