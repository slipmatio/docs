# Version 3 Migration

Slipmat version 3 does not share any code with the old v2 platform. But we do have access to the old data so we've tried to make the transition as easy and simple as possible for all users.

## Migrating User Account - Step By Step

Trying to log in or register to the new site with an email that has already been used on the legacy site will prompt you to verify it first. Here's how the flow goes:

1. [Log In](https://next.slipmat.io/login/) or reset your password if you haven't set one for v3 yet.
2. Open your email and click the link (or manually open the address) to open the verification page.
3. When you open the page, your account will be verified, your old data will be migrated, and you'll be logged in automatically.

That's it! Welcome aboard!

## Migrating Artist Profile - Step By Step

1. First complete the user account migration. When you migrate your old user account that is connected to a v2 artist profile, your account will get a "OG DJ" flag that allows you to migrate your artist data.
2. After logging in you'll see "Artist" tab. Click that and you'll be redirected to an onboarding page.
3. Read the instructions and click the button. The onboarding is instant, you'll get your new streaming key and instructions and you can start streaming right away. That's it!

::: warning Note
Slipmat v2 was created in 2016 and some of the older artist metadata is **really** old by now. You should set up a new good quality artist photo and default event photo to make sure your marketing looks sharp!
