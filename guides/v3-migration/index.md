# Version 3 Migration

After 4 years of building features, tools, and experimenting with new ideas, Slipmat's Version 3 is here! This time has been spent creating building blocks for better live streaming experience, developing tools for artists, and testing different approaches to improve the experience for both performers and listeners. You can see some of our experimental work, like the [Show Scripter](https://scripter.labs.slipmat.io), on our [Labs page](https://labs.slipmat.io).

## The Plan

Instead of releasing everything at once, we'll introduce new features gradually:

1. Current users get an early access to Version 3
2. Once all features from the old site are tested and working in Version 3, we'll move everyone to the new platform
3. Finally, we'll open registration for new users

All your data will automatically move to the new platform.

## Early Access

::: danger Not Open Yet!
Early Access opens in December 2024. We'll email all users when the doors open.
:::

Everyone will eventually be upgraded to the new platform automatically but if you want an early access to see and test the new features, here's how to do it:

1. [Sign in to your current Slipmat account](https://slipmat.io/m/logout-damnit/)
2. Go to https://next.slipmat.io
3. Click `I Want Early Access`

That's it! After upgrading, you can start using the new platform right away.

## Having Problems?

The upgrade might not work if you're:

- Using an old browser
- Using a mobile device
- Have JavaScript disabled

Most modern browsers with standard settings will work fine. If you have problems:

1. Try using a different browser
2. If issues continue, get help on Discord or Backstage
