# Version 3 Migration

After 5 years of building features, tools, and experimenting with new ideas, Slipmat's Version 3 is here! This time has been spent creating building blocks for better live streaming experience, developing tools for artists, and testing different approaches to improve the experience for both performers and listeners. You can see some of our experimental work, like the [Show Scripter](https://scripter.labs.slipmat.io), on our [Labs page](https://labs.slipmat.io).

## The Plan

Instead of releasing everything at once, we'll introduce new features gradually:

1. Current users get an early access to Version 3
2. Once all features from the old site are tested and working in Version 3, we'll move everyone to the new platform

All your data will automatically move to the new platform.

## Early Access

::: danger Only for old Slipmat users
Early Access has been extended in December 2025. We'll email all existing users when the public v3 launches.
:::

Everyone will eventually be upgraded to the new platform automatically but if you want an early access to see and test the new features, here's how to do it:

1. Head over to https://next.slipmat.io/register/
   1. If you have a v2 account, you can [sign in to v2](https://slipmat.io/m/logout-damnit/) to have your v3 account created automatically upon next [v3 login](https://next.slipmat.io/login/), or request a registration link via email. All your artist details will be migrated automatically.
   2. If you are new to Slipmat, you can register a fresh account manually (note that artist registration is not yet open!).

That's it! After upgrading, you can start using the new platform right away.

## Having Problems?

If you have any problems:

1. Try using a different browser (Slipmat v3 requires a modern browser)
2. If issues continue, get help on Discord or Backstage
