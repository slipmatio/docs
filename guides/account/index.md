# Slipmat Account

## Your Data

Our business is making unforgettable musical experiences, not your data.

Your data is yours. We promise to keep it secure and never sell it or abuse it.

### How To Export Your Data

Find `Download User Data` heading from [your account page](https://slipmat.io/account/). Clicking the "export my data" button starts a collection process that goes through every single piece of data you have ever created on Slipmat and bundles it to a one big zip file. Depending on your activity on Slipmat this process could take anywhere from few seconds to few hours. You can safely browse away or close the page, this whole process is happening under the hood.

When the collection process is done, you'll get an email and a notification on the site. You'll now find a download button from the account page.

Your data is in a big JSON file, which is a machine-readable and easy to use format. (It would be nice to have a more human-browseable view to all this data. If you want to help in building this, [feel free to contribute](/development/contributing/)!)

### What data we collect

- Your profile data (ie. everything that you fill in your profile)
- Your listening activity (to make your browsing experience better)
- Your activity on the site (to help us to make the site better)
- Public chat logs (only available to artists)

## How To Delete Your Account
