# For Artists

## Frankie Streaming Server

The quality of the (audio) stream is one of the most important priorities in Slipmat technical design. We've built our
own streaming server called Frankie (after Frankie Knuckles). It's designed to deliver a stable live stream with
pristine audio quality, video quality being a low priority.

Due to the unique design of Frankie, artists need to take extra care to deliver the absolutely right format stream from
OBS or any other RTMP streaming software.
