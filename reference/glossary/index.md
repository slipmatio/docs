# Slipmat.io Glossary

This glossary is written for a easy to read and link to documentaton for Slipmat-related things.

### Backstage

A Discourse-powered discussion forum for Slipmat users. Uses Slipmat account for authentication.

Note that Backstage and the rest of the Slipmat universe have nothing in comon; they live in separate siloes so one does not affect the other. The only connection between the two systems is the initial connection you do when you create your Backstage account when logging in to BAckstage with your Slipmat credentials for the first time.

### Discord

Discord is a chat platform that hosts chatrooms for all kinds of communities. Slipmat Community Chat is our Discord server. You can join by [following this invite link](https://discord.gg/PCSwhkZ). Note that Discord is a third-party service that has nothing to do with Slipmat services -- we just have a chatroom there.
